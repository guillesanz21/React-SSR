# SSR with React

Web page created following the course "Server Side Rendering with Reack and Redux" by "Stephen Grider" in the Udemy platform.

The sole purpose of this web application is to set up the architecture of the server that handles the Server Side Rendering (SSR) of a React Application.
The SSR is approached from scratch without any popular libraries (or frameworks), such as Next.js, so it's an ideal course for learning the mechanics of SSR with React, Redux and Authentication.

The app request data from an API server hosted in Herkou.
